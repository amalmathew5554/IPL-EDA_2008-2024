# IPL-EDA_2008-2024
Exploratory Data Analysis of IPL match trends (2008–2024) using Python. Includes preprocessing, 15+ visualizations, and insights on teams, toss, venues, and players.

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing IPL match-level data from 2008 to 2024.  
Using Python and visualization libraries, I have explored trends such as:
- Toss decisions and their impact on match outcomes
- Team performance across seasons
- Venue influence on results
- Player of the Match trends
- Distribution of winning margins (runs/wickets)

The project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

# Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle:  
[IPL Complete Dataset (2008–2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020)

I cleaned and extended it to include matches up to 2024.  
The cleaned dataset used in this notebook is `ipl_cleaned.csv`.

# Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and pre processing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and reporting

# Key Visualizations
- Matches played per season
- Matches won by team
- Toss decision preferences
- Toss winner vs match winner
- Player of the Match leaders
- Venue-wise matches
- Win margins by runs/wickets
- Season-wise trends

# Insights
- Winning the toss does not always guarantee winning the match.
- Certain teams dominate specific venues.
- Finals are usually tighter contests compared to league games.
- Some players consistently earn "Player of the Match" awards across seasons.
- Trends show variations in batting-first vs chasing wins across years.
